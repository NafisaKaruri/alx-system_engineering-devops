CMD CHALLENGE 'https://cmdchallenge.com/'

This is a game that challenges the Bash skills, it starts easy and then gradually gets harder.

In this directory you will find the solution to the first 27 tasks.
I did the challenge locally and screenshoted every 9 tasks, then I opened the bash in the directory were the screenshots were uploaded, then connected to the sandbox using SFTP, once I was connected I uploaded the screenshots using the put command, then finally pushed every thing to GitHub.
